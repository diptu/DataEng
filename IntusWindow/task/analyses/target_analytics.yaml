      This analysis model calculates key marketing performance metrics, including Cost per Acquisition (CPA), Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI), and Event Conversion Rate.
                  It aggregates data from marketing events and sales transactions to provide insights into marketing effectiveness.

                  **Important Notes:**

                  - This model is configured to be an `ephemeral` model, meaning it won't materialize as a physical table in the data warehouse.
